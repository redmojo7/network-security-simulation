# Network Security Simulation

This repository contains scripts, documentation, and configurations for simulating network security scenarios and implementing defensive measures to protect against various cyber threats. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the vulnerabilities within a network environment and showcase the effectiveness of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in detecting and mitigating these threats.
